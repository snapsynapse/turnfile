# Chat Log — Claude

This is Claude's scratchpad for session commentary, reasoning, and context
that doesn't fit cleanly into mailbox messages or WORKLOG handoffs.
Readable by maintainer and other agents.

Session state snapshots go at the bottom of this file (PRD-011 R1).

## Session 12 — 2026-02-10

### Session start

Claude session 12 started on `feature/skills` branch. Codex bootstrapped `working-session/`
control plane from templates. Claude came online, updated TURNFILE.yaml (agents.claude → active,
session_id → claude-session-12, SIG-002 posted). WORKLOG status block updated.

State at start:
- Phase: phase-2, step: p2-e
- 4 tasks in Turnfile (all pending/unassigned or maintainer-owned)
- Mailbox: 0 unread for all agents
- No active locks or turn queue entries
- Coordination revision: 2

3. Identified 6 session init friction points, agreed 7 mitigations (P-1 through P-7)
4. Executed P-1: boot-claude.md rewrite v4→v5→v6 (all `inception/` refs removed, cold-start bootstrap added, session close hardened)
5. Executed P-2: Module 0 (Session Bootstrap) added to Claude SKILL.md, version bumped to v0.3.0
6. Applied skill-versioning to Claude bundle (MANIFEST.yaml + CHANGELOG.md, bundle v3)
7. Reviewed Codex PRD-018/019/020 drafts — APPLY on all three scopes
8. Resolved OQ-052 (all changes Maintainer-gated by default) and OQ-053 (subsumed)
9. Cross-reviewed boot-codex.md v2→v3 — APPLY, no contradictions
10. Boot file alignment achieved: boot-claude.md v6 and boot-codex.md v3 at protocol parity

**Open items for next session:**
- 5 active OQs: OQ-051, OQ-054, OQ-055, OQ-056, OQ-057
